== Fraud Detection and Investigation Using Graph Data Science Library

Example GDS workflow to demonstrate fraud detection and investigation using Neo4j Graph Data Science. This browser guide contains snippets of cypher code and a brief explanation in each slide to help with the demo.

We will use the GDS Library to get you started with few scenarios in first party and synthetic identity fraud detection and investigation.

== Problem Definition

=== *What is Fraud?*

*Fraud occurs* when an individual or group of individuals, or a business entity *intentionally* deceives another individual or business entity with *misrepresentation* of identity, products, services, or financial transactions and/or *false promises* with no intention of fulfilling them.

* *Second-party Fraud*
** An individual knowingly gives their identity or personal information to another individual to commit fraud or someone is perpetrating fraud in his behalf.

* *Third-party Fraud*
** An individual, or a group of individuals, create or use another person's identity, or personal details, to open or takeover an account.

== Exercises

We will use Neo4j GDS library to detect and label two types of fraudsters

. First party fraudsters (Module #1)
. Money Mules (Module #2)

== Preliminary Data Analysis

We will use Paysim dataset for the hands-on exercises. Paysim is a synthetic dataset that mimics real world mobile money transfer network.

Let's explore the dataset.

. Database Schema and Stats
. Nodes and Relationships
. Transaction Types
